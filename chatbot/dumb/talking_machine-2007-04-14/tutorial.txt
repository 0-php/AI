1	WHAT IS TALKING MACHINE?

Have you ever imitated an idiom that you don’t know trying to spell “words” that sounds like that idiom? It’s sure that yes.

Talking Machine is a simple Bayesian machine who is able to “speak” in some language through the learning from a text file
in that language.

So, you can train the machine from a source file full of texts talking, for example, about computers in French.
Then you can use the machine to:

1.	Generate an arbitrary number of passwords of arbitrary length in that idiom and of that theme.
	Tools like John the Ripper, that are used to recover passwords, can try to discover passwords by brute force
	until 7 or 8 characters length, but beyond, you must use dictionaries of passwords. Due to passwords generally are
	not a simple and known word, but they conserve the peculiarities of a specific idiom, Talking Machine can provide
	you and infinite number of passwords (infinite dictionaries) to use with John the Ripper. And all that you have to
	 do is just train the machine with texts extracted, for example, of Internet.

2.	Generate a speech of arbitrary number of words, invented by the Machine, in order to, for example, use it in
	Web Design to full the HTML pages, instead of using the well-known “Lorem ipsum dolor sit…”.
	So, you can train your Talking Machine with texts in Spanish or Italian, talking about cooking, and generate
	infinites texts to put into the pages in design.

3.	Have Fun! You can have a chat with the machine, but with a characteristic, as you say phrases to it,
	the machine will assign more weight to your words, increasing the probability of repeating what you say.

Talking machine is a command line tool but you can extract the class from the TM.php file and use it anywhere.


2	HOW TO TRAIN THE MACHINE

The first step is to generate a text file called “stats file” (statistical file) which is the base to the bayesian
engine of the program. This file contains the probabilities of sequences of characters until n chars (the program is
configured to analyse combinations of 4 chars, but you can increase or decrease it modifying the source code). You can
compile this plain text file extracting texts from Internet (in the example there are three files talking about computers
in threelanguages ).

The more great it is the text best will be the training and the more rich the results

Then, you must execute the command line:

>php TM.php –train TEXT_FILE_INPUT         STATS_FILE_OUTPUT



where TEXT_FILE_INPUT is the text in any language, and STATS_FILE_OUTPUT is the result that TM will generate
(a text file with an associative PHP array with all the probabilities).

Then, you will have file (like stats_computers_en.txt) that TM will use for its texts generation.

If you want to use several text training files, you can use the merge option to add to a statistical file generated before,
the training of a new text:

>php –train   NEW_STATS_FILE    NEW_TEXT_TRAINING    OLD_STATS_FILE


3	GENERATING PASSWORDS


At this point, you can use TM to generate an infinite number of passwords in order to being used, for example, with
John the Ripper.

You can select the length of the passwords (8 by default) and the number of passwords (1000 by default).

A good idea for this use is training TM with pre-existing dictionaries of passwords, by this way, you will generate infinite variations of known passwords and you will increase your possibilities of recover your lost password.

The command line is:

<php TM.php –pass STATS_FILE    PASS_FILE_OUTPUT  [PASS LENGTH]    [NUMBER OF PASS]


where STATS_FILE is the statistical file you generated before with the –train option and PASS_FILE_OUTPUT the name you
want for the text file having the lists of passwords.

If you examine the file generated, you can find something like this:

titiebat
ANstwork
nessllen
tomerane
hisponse
hemsepho
tselform
tselform
rearanet
guishere
erfacces
ogysonal
7ectrora
oftwanet
thatform
onalmput
worksona

Where is the good thing here? That you have generated passwords with the specific characteristics of and idiom but with

invented words, like humans do when they try to invent a password.
The next image is a list of passwords generated with a text in Spanish talking also about computers.

ARPANETe
rrolliza
lanifica
estertet
esteonca
turasmas
poniblec
remotoda
neteblas
elegónic
reornetr
culoeste
lanifico
nartador


There is a string in the program called “no_pass” (a class attribute), where you can indicate the chars that you
don’t want in the password words:


var	$no_pass = " ,.!?\':[]();";



4	GENERATING ARBITRAY TEXTS


If you are a web designer, sure you are tired of use the “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet…” texts to fill up the pages in
construction, in order to verify the correct aspect of a page.

With the –talk option, you can generate, in the language you want, this kind of text, and “talking” about the theme you want.
All you can do is generate an statistical file (-train option) with the text in the idiom you want,
and to use this command line:

>php TM.php –talk   STATS_FILE    TEXT_OUTPUT   [Nª WORDS]


where the TEXT_OUTPUT is the plain text file where TM will create its “speech”. The nº of words is by default 1000.

Then you will have a paragraph like this:

This is another one in French:

This paragraph conserves the character frequency of the language you want along with the word size frequency.


5	HAVE A CHAT
You can have a chat with the machine, whit the –dialog option.

>php -dialog STATS_FILE

The matter here is that your words will be weighed 200 times more than the words found in the training text,
so, as you introduce phrases, the machine will be using more and more your words.

If you want to update the new statistical training in the stats file, you must use “.save[ENTER]”.
