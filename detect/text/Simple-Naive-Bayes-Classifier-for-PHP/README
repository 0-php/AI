Simple NaiveBayesClassifier for PHP
-----------------------------------

This project is somewhat a fork of a Ruby implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier <https://github.com/alexandru/stuff-classifier>. There is a blog posts <http://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html> finely written and simple in its algorithm which I'm sure just about anyone can implement in any programming language.

The project is implemented in PHP in its simplest form. Fork it and play with the codes.

Major redesign with the codes to only use Redis as store. Very impressive benchmarks.
* Redis using php-redis extension <https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis>


Changelist
----------

[18 October 2012]
Added offset/row to classify method and also deTrain method to tackle data updates if applicable.

[14 October 2012]
Optimization - Classify method and Redis store are updated to do calculations after all the data is acquired first to speed up results.


How To Use/Test
---------------

Run the index.php file on command line, any arguments passed after the index.php file will be treated as keywords.

$ php index.php technology apple mobile


Performance
-----------

Very high performance by implementing the store with Redis. Using hashmaps and namespacing to minimize classifying time.
